This study develops a predictive system integrating telematics and images from trailer activities to enhance cost attribution, and toll & damage tracking in the logistics business model. Our goal is to automate trailer toll data attribution and enhance damage detection by leveraging telematics data and applying image classification with deep learning. Our results will help automate damage identification and severity assessment, aggregate tolls with the corresponding trip, and ensure proper attribution to the correct parties in the freight chain.
